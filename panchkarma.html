            <h3>Vamana</h3>
            <p>
              Vamana is one of the five treatments in Panchakarma in Ayurveda.
              Vamana is a treatment in which a therapeutic vomiting is induced
              to relieve an excessive Kapha Dosha from a body. An excessive
              mucus is eliminated from the body through the gastrointestinal and
              respiratory route. Kapha is situated in the chest region and
              increased Kapha Dosha can lead to diseases like a cough and cold.
            </p>
            <p>
              By expelling the excessive Kapha from the body, an individual can
              expect a good voice and improved appetite. Vamana therapy is
              beneficial in case of asthma, diabetes and certain skin problems
              like psoriasis. Vamana is fruitful in clearing sinuses,
              congestion, wheezing, and breathlessness.

            <p>
              Virechana is one of the Panchakarma treatment performed to flush
              out the body toxins. Virechana is advised in case of increased
              Pitta Dosha. Virechana is useful in order to improve bowel
              movements and to treat nonhealing wounds, piles, and ulcer,
              blisters, abscess, jaundice and liver diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Virechana is beneficial and often advised to diabetic patients.
              Diabetic patients need to have a clear blood vessel and the
              ability to quickly heal the wounds. Diabetic patients also suffer
              from the burning sensation in the palms and feet. Virechana
              Ayurvedic therapy effectively treats the burning sensation in
              diabetic patients.

            <h3>Nasya</h3>
            <p>
              Nasya - a Panchakarma Ayurvedic treatment focuses on the nasal
              route. Nasya is effective in treating ear, nose and throat
              disorders. In this treatment, herbal oil, powder, and juices
              (swaras) are instilled through the nasal track to treat the
              disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process starts with a facial massage or a steam to forehead,
              face, head, ears, and neck to loosen the adhesive doshas. After
              that, a lukewarm medication is instilled in both the nostrils
              using a proper instrument followed by a massage to sole, shoulder,
              neck, ear and palms. After that, the individual is given a
              lukewarm water to gargle in order to clean the mouth and a
              medicated smoke is given to inhale afterward.

            Visiting Lotus Healthcare and Aesthetic clinic for years, even from
            Frankfurt, Germany, I've found it to be the best. They offers
            excellent treatments, including Stress Management Massage and
            Shirodhara. These relieve stress from work and daily life.

            Suffering from diabetes and chronic cough for a decade, I turned to
            Lotus Diabetes Reversal Program. In 180 days, my sugar normalized,
            insulin ceased, and diabetes-free for 2 years. Grateful to Dr.
            Ganesh Avhad.
